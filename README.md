## **Password Reset Process:**

1. **User Initiates Reset:**
   - User visits a designated "Forgot Password" page or link.
   - User enters their email address or username.
   - Application sends a password reset email containing a unique token.
2. **Token Verification:**
   - User clicks the link in the password reset email.
   - Application verifies the token's validity and expiration.
   - If valid, user is redirected to a password reset form.
3. **New Password Set:**
   - User enters a new password in the form.
   - Application validates the new password for strength and security requirements.
   - Application updates the user's password in the database.
   - User is redirected to a success page or login page.

### **Additional Considerations:**

- **Token Expiration:** Tokens should have a reasonable expiration time to ensure security.
- **Password Strength:** Enforce strong password policies to protect user accounts.
- **Email Delivery:** Ensure reliable email delivery for password reset messages.
- **Error Handling:** Implement clear error messages for invalid tokens, expired tokens, or failed password resets.
- **Security:** Protect against potential attacks such as brute force attempts or token theft.
- **Frontend Integration:** Describe how the frontend interacts with these endpoints to guide user actions and display appropriate messages.
- **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of the password reset flow to ensure functionality and security.
